# Module One Starter Code

## Description

 This was a on the job ticket assignment where the client wanted their website to be more accessible. The assignment also required updating the existing code so that it was more efficient and easier to read. This was done by changing class and id names, adding html semantics and changing the color of certain elements to meet WCAG guidelines.
